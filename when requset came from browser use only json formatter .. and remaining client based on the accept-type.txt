when request came from the browser we are sending content with applicaion/json
but for other client. like applicatoin/fidler/postman etc.., we have to send the 
content based on the accept type ...

solution 1:-> 
===========

           var jsonformatter = config.Formatters.JsonFormatter;
            jsonformatter.SupportedMediaTypes.Add(new System.Net.Http.Headers.MediaTypeHeaderValue("text/html"));
         //   config.Formatters.Remove(xmlformatter);

the above solution definiong i.e when accept-type : text/html then also send the json formatter content result only
but problem with this approach is 
it will send the content-type: based on the accept-type 

if accept type is text/html
then it send content-type is text/html



our goal is 
==========
when accept-type is text/html
it will return content-type is text/html for browser 
and  
 content-type is applciatoin/json for other application




normally browser sending the accept-type in the requestr as follows
------------------------------------------------------------------
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9

response-contain 
the 

 content-type :-> text/html instead of 
		  application/json

this response of the content type will be problem when using in the postman/or client application etc..,
b/z we are returnig the json content but showing the contet-type is "text/html"

we want to show this content-type as "applicaiton/json"


solution-2:-> 
============
 -> customeize the json Responses
